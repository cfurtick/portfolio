    <p>I am going to be a senior at Nathan Hale High School and I love to learn how to code! I play soccer, gymnastics, and softball for my school. Outside of that, I love to hike, go for runs with my dad, cook with my mom, do fun art projects, and go on adventures with my friends. I have an older sister named Natalie who is going to University of Colorado next year, a dog named Ross, and a cat named Mona. I am not pursuing photography but I absolutely love to take photos of everything.*see if i can add some of my photos below</p>
